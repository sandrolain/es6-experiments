# ES6 Experiments <i style="font-size: 0.5em">(with secret-lab)</i>

Here you will find a collection of small experimental scripts using the new features of ES6. You can consider them an exercise in style, or if you find them useful to use them in your work.

At the moment we have in the laboratory:

- **promport**: module import with Promise
- **sleep**: sleep function with Promise
- **array-filters**: collection of function for array.filter method

Once you have cloned or downloaded the repository you can find some test files in the directory / test.  
*At the moment the test results are visible in the browser javascript console.*
